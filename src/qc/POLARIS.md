# src/qc

## Purpose

The QC subsystem is the provider-agnostic Quality Control layer for Polaris. It invokes external reviewer providers at governed lifecycle triggers, parses and normalizes their output into Polaris-native findings, applies severity, attribution, auto-fix, and repair routing policy, and persists durable cluster-scoped QC artifacts. It does not implement worker dispatch or cluster delivery.

**Domain:** quality-control  
**Route:** src/qc

## What belongs here

- `orchestration.ts` — `runQcAtTrigger()`: invokes active providers, collects outputs, and returns aggregate policy action. Does not own repair-loop dispatch or round transitions; those are owned by the callers of `runQcRepairLoop()` (currently `src/finalize/index.ts` and `src/loop/parent.ts`). `src/qc/` compiles the repair packet manifest only.
- `provider.ts` — `IQcProvider`, `QcReviewScope`, `QcProviderOutput`, `QcProviderRegistry` interfaces and base contracts.
- `registry.ts` — `QcProviderRegistry` singleton; registers concrete provider adapters.
- `providers/` — one file per provider adapter (e.g., `coderabbit.ts`); each adapter parses provider-specific output into `QcFinding[]`.
- `types.ts` — normalized `QcFinding`, `QcResult`, `QcProviderFailure`, `QcRepairPacket`, `QcRepairRound`, `QcRepairLoopState`, attribution, status, severity, and routing decision types. `QcResult.headSha` records the git HEAD SHA reviewed by that QC run (set by `orchestration.ts`) and is the basis for the sealed-reviewed-SHA evidence surfaced by `src/finalize/`.
- `schemas.ts` — Zod/JSON schema definitions for all QC artifacts.
- `policy.ts` — severity policy, auto-fix eligibility, and delivery blocking decisions.
- `attribution.ts` — evidence-based finding attribution to children (commit-line-match, changed-file-owner, child-scope-match, etc.).
- `severity.ts` — severity normalization and provider-label mapping.
- `routing.ts` — repair routing decisions (original-worker, repair-worker, follow-up, operator-review, medic).
- `runner.ts` — provider execution wrapper; classifies non-finding failures into `QcProviderFailure`.
- `autofix.ts` — auto-fix eligibility gating and application hooks.
- `artifacts.ts` — QC result artifact read/write helpers (cluster-scoped, atomic).
- `triggers.ts` — trigger-level policy (pr, completed-cluster, child).
- `security-category.ts` — security/auth/data-loss category constants for grouping guards.
- `index.ts` — public re-exports.
- `*.test.ts` — unit and integration tests.

## What does not belong here

- Worker dispatch and Worker Router decisions — belongs in `src/loop/dispatch.ts` and `src/loop/router/`.
- PR creation, push, or tracker closeout — belongs in `src/finalize/`.
- Cluster state reads/writes — belongs in `src/cluster-state/` (QC writes artifacts; cluster-state stores pointers).
- SOL scoring and proposal routing — belongs in `src/autoresearch/`.
- Config loading and schema validation — belongs in `src/config/`.

## Editing rules

- QC providers are external critics, not worker providers. Providers must never be dispatched through the Worker Router; they are invoked directly by `runner.ts`.
- Provider execution failures (`timeout`, `rate-limited`, `auth-failure`, `command-not-found`, `nonzero-exit`, `parse-failed`, `empty-output`, `unusable-output`, `unsupported-mode`, `unavailable-provider`) are classified as `QcProviderFailure`, not as findings. All failures must produce telemetry.
- `unusable-output` covers provider payloads that parse successfully but contain no actionable finding. A record has no actionable finding when it lacks `file`/`path` and `message`/`title`/`summary`/`description`/`body`/`suggestion`/`fix` content, or when its only `title` duplicates the `category`, `type`, or `rule`. Bookkeeping-only records (`severity`, `category`, `rule`, `id`, `findingId`, `providerFindingId`) and progress/status/heartbeat/complete records are therefore unusable output, except for a terminal `complete` record that explicitly reports zero findings (`findings: 0`, `summary.total: 0`, or `summary.issues: 0`) with status `review_completed`, `review_skipped`, `completed`, `complete`, `done`, or `success` (no review was performed).
- `runner.ts` classifies provider exit code `143` (the shell convention for SIGTERM, `128 + SIGTERM`) as `timeout`, in addition to `error.killed` with `signal === "SIGTERM"`.
- Repair workers that address QC findings are dispatched by the caller of `runQcRepairLoop()` (currently `src/finalize/index.ts` and `src/loop/parent.ts`) with `worker_role: repair`. `src/qc/` compiles the repair packet manifest; it does not dispatch workers.
- Repair packet manifests are written to `.polaris/clusters/<cluster-id>/qc/repair-rounds/<round>/repair-packets.json`.
- Max repair rounds is `2` by default, overridable by `polaris.config.json → qc.maxRepairRounds`. The loop must stop when `round > maxRepairRounds`.
- Each repair worker dispatch is bounded by `polaris.config.json → qc.repairDispatchTimeoutMs` (default `1_800_000` ms, 30 minutes). A dispatch that exceeds the timeout is recorded as a failure/timeout result.
- A finding may be marked `repaired` only after a post-repair QC run or explicit validation evidence from the repair worker's result packet.
- Grouping rules for repair packets: group by file + root-cause/category when ranges overlap; do not mix security/auth/data-loss/migration/governance findings with unrelated work.
- Parallelism is governed by `parallel_group`, `conflicts_with`, and scope overlap. Do not mark packets as parallel-safe if `allowed_scope` sets overlap or either touches shared governance/config files.
- All QC artifacts written to `.polaris/clusters/<cluster-id>/qc/` must use atomic writes. Never call `fs.writeFile()` directly on artifact paths.
- The repair loop emits `qc-repair-worker-dispatch-start` before each repair worker dispatch and `qc-repair-worker-dispatch-timeout` if the dispatch timeout fires. See the event catalog in `smartdocs/specs/active/quality-control-architecture.md §8.9` and the implementation in `src/qc/repair-loop.ts`.

## Provider config model

Extend `QcProviderConfig` (in `src/config/schema.ts`) to support:

```ts
interface QcProviderExecutionConfig {
  name: string;
  mode: "local" | "pr" | "metrics-import";
  command?: string;
  args?: string[];
  outputFormat?: "coderabbit" | "pr-agent" | "generic-json" | "jsonl" | "markdown";
  parser?: string;
  trigger?: "pr" | "completed-cluster" | "child";
  capabilities?: QcProviderCapability[];
  autoFixEligible?: boolean;
  timeoutMs?: number;
  rateLimitPolicy?: "fallback" | "block" | "follow-up" | "skip";
  failurePolicy?: "fallback" | "block" | "follow-up" | "skip";
  primary?: boolean;
  fallback?: string[];
  severityMapping?: Record<string, QcSeverity>;
  /** Path to a CodeRabbit config file (e.g. `.coderabbit.yaml`). */
  configPath?: string;
}
```

## CodeRabbit review scope for `.polaris/` artifacts

Tracked `.polaris/` artifacts are not uniformly reviewable. CodeRabbit review scope is defined by the root `.coderabbit.yaml` `reviews.path_filters` and mirrored by `src/finalize/artifact-policy.ts` (`getCodeRabbitReviewScope`, `isCodeRabbitReviewablePath`).

- **In scope** (durable state evidence promoted into finalize commits):
  - Active cluster `clusters.json`, `cluster-state.json`, `state.json`
  - `.polaris/runs/ledger.jsonl` (durable audit log)
  - `.polaris/cognition/archive/**` (durable provenance)
  - `.polaris/map/**` (durable derived artifacts)
- **Out of scope** (runtime/sealed/noise artifacts):
  - Active cluster `packets/**`, `results/**`, `qc/**` (sealed worker packets and raw QC output)
  - `.polaris/runs/` runtime files and subdirectories (legacy, mutation queue, current-state, etc.)
  - `.polaris/bootstrap/**`, `.polaris/tmp/**`, `.polaris/cognition/pending/**`
  - `.taskchain_artifacts/**` and `*.bak` (workspace scratch)

The local CodeRabbit CLI uses the same `.coderabbit.yaml` as the GitHub App via `--config .coderabbit.yaml` (default `CodeRabbitQcProvider.DEFAULT_CODERABBIT_CONFIG_PATH`). Set `qc.providers.coderabbit.execution.configPath` to override.

## Repair loop state machine

States (managed by `src/qc/repair-loop.ts`):

`qc_review_requested` → `qc_provider_attempted` → `qc_results_normalized` → `repair_packets_compiled` → `repair_packets_dispatched` → `repair_results_collected` → `qc_rerun_requested` → (loop) or terminal state

Terminal states (`QcRepairLoopOutcome` in `src/loop/checkpoint.ts`): `pass`, `qc-disabled`, `no-repairable`, `medic-referral`, `operator-review`, `all-providers-failed`, `max-rounds`. These are the exact string literals stored in `state.qc_repair_loop.terminal_outcome` and `ClusterState.qc_repair_outcome`; finalize's repair-loop gate (`src/finalize/index.ts`) matches against them directly. The repair-loop constants `QC_REPAIR_TERMINAL_OUTCOMES`, `QC_REPAIR_CONVERGED_OUTCOMES`, and `QC_REPAIR_ESCALATION_OUTCOMES` (in `src/qc/repair-loop.ts`) encode this catalog.

The loop stops at the first round that satisfies one of the terminal outcomes. It is bounded by `qc.maxRepairRounds` (default `DEFAULT_MAX_REPAIR_ROUNDS = 2` in `src/qc/repair-loop.ts`).

Classification:

- **Converged / trusted** (finalize may proceed without an operator resolution): `pass`, `qc-disabled`, `no-repairable`.
- **Escalation** (finalize blocks unless a valid `resolution.json` is present for the current round): `medic-referral`, `operator-review`, `all-providers-failed`, `max-rounds`.

`max-rounds` is an escalation outcome, never a converged or trusted outcome. It is returned when the configured round limit is exhausted and findings are still open; finalize must not silently proceed as if the loop converged.

Operator-review findings do not bypass packet compilation: the loop still compiles a repair manifest for the round, but it dispatches only eligible `repair-worker` packets. `operator-review` packets settle the terminal `operator-review` outcome directly without worker dispatch.

See `smartdocs/specs/active/quality-control-architecture.md §8.9` for the telemetry-aligned terminal outcome catalog that matches these values (§8.6–8.7 predate the implemented naming).

## Artifact paths

- QC run result: `.polaris/clusters/<cluster-id>/qc/<qc-run-id>.json`
- Raw provider output: `.polaris/clusters/<cluster-id>/qc/<qc-run-id>-raw.<ext>`
- Repair packet manifest: `.polaris/clusters/<cluster-id>/qc/repair-rounds/<round>/repair-packets.json`
- Operator resolution artifact: `.polaris/clusters/<cluster-id>/qc/repair-rounds/<round>/resolution.json`

## Operator resolution

The terminal outcomes `operator-review` and `medic-referral` require an operator to formally record a decision before finalize can proceed. Use:

```
polaris qc resolve --cluster-id <cluster-id> --outcome <pass|no-repairable> --reason "<text>" [--findings <id1,id2,...>]
```

The command writes a durable `resolution.json` for the current repair round. The artifact contains:

- `resolver` — git `user.name` (or `lsctech` if unset)
- `resolvedAt` — ISO 8601 timestamp
- `resolvedOutcome` — `pass` or `no-repairable`
- `reason` — non-empty operator justification
- `findings` — finding IDs from the round's `repair-packets.json` that the resolution addresses (defaults to all referenced findings)

`finalize` (`validateQcRepairLoopGate` in `src/finalize/index.ts`) treats a valid `resolution.json` for the current round as equivalent to a trusted `terminal_outcome`; finalize proceeds without mutating `state.qc_repair_loop.terminal_outcome`. The resolution artifact must be present — the gate is not weakened for `operator-review` or `medic-referral` without it.

## Architecture assumptions

- QC providers are external critics; the runtime owns routing, attribution, and policy decisions.
- Repair workers are dispatched by the caller of `runQcRepairLoop()` through a configured `ExecutionAdapter`, not by the QC subsystem directly.
- The repair loop is bounded by `qc.maxRepairRounds` and `qc.repairDispatchTimeoutMs` and terminates deterministically.
